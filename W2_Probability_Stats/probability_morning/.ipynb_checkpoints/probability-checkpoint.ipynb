We can rest (a little) easy knowing that a random variable has within it a set of possible outcomes; in fact, much of the notation used for probability treats the random variable _like a set_. So, it's all cool.\n",

    "## Continuous vs Discrete (Random) Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "All above, we only talked about _discrete_ random variables (although we didn't use that term until now). However, a random variable (or a variable in general) need not be discrete. Here's the difference between _discrete_ and _continuous_: [ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_and_discrete_variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discrete**: there is a positive, minimum difference between two values the variable can take\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuous**: between two values the variable can take, there are uncountably infinite other values the variable can take\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to put it: There are measurable \"gaps\" between value of a discrete variable, where the gaps between values of a continuous variable can be made infinitesimal.\n",
